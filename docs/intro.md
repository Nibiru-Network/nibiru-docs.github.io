# Getting started with Nibiru
---

[Nibiru Network](https://www.nibirunet.io) is a decentralized storage, bandwidth and compute blockchain network
that is designed to allow anyone to participate in a permissionless manner.  Anyone who has surplus storage, newtorking bandwidth and/or compute resources, can easily become a part of the Nibiru ecosystem.

There are 3 ways to participate in the Nibiru ecosystem:

* **Share** your extra compute, storage and network bandwidth resources to bring the vision of a truly decentralized cloud to reality.
* **Earn** rewards by staking in multiple ways or contributing your extra computing resources to the network.
* **Build** using your existing Solidity skills to build new, or migrate existing Dapps to the EVM-compatible Nibiru Network.



## Share
Rarely do we fully utilize the storage space, bandwidth and compute resources that our computers have.  With the Nibiru Network's unique Proof of Flow (PoF) and Proof of Capacity (PoC) layer 2 consensus mechanisms, you can turn those spare resources into rentable resources.

## Earn
When sharing your surplus computing resources, you are rewarded in two ways:
1. Through PoF adn PoC consensus rewards
2. Through participants of the network renting your surplus resources for thier personal or business needs.

## Build
As an EVM-compatible network, developers familiar with Ethereum development languages and tool chains can focus on developing new, or migrating existing, Dapps for the Nibiru Network rather than learning new skills.  

## More coming soon!

While the Nibiru Network is [live](https://www.nibiruscan.io) today, we're currently focusing on encouraging the community on-board to the network through deploying a validator node on the network.  Later this year, network participants will be able to **Share** and **Earn**.  If you're ready to help **Build** the Nibiru network and earning MPoS NBN rewards, continue on to the [**Next Step**](become-a-validator/get-started-validator.md) and deploy a validator.
