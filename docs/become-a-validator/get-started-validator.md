# Getting Started
---

Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains like the Nibiru Network rely on the service of validator nodes 
to perform the important role of verifying and processing transactions, and generating new blocks 
on the blockchain.  As validator nodes are crucial to the performance and security of the network, 
liquidity is staked into the nodes in the form of NBN, which can be slashed in the event that the 
node does not perform its intended function.  Validator nodes that perform properly are compensated 
for their service in NBN.

## Multi Proof of Stake
Multi Proof of Stake (MPoS) is a layer one consensus algorithm used in Nibiru Network
that is based on the original Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, but with
modifications to address certain issues or limitations.

It presets two pools of candidate nodes with different proportions of candidates (upper and lower 
house system). In each round of witness node election, a corresponding number of nodes are selected 
according to the equity algorithm to give the right to produce blocks (that is, verification node), 
and at the same time combined with the benefit algorithm to ensure that each participant can get 
the opportunity to produce a block.

For further information on MPoS and its benefits, see the 
[whitepaper](https://www.nibirunet.io/whitepaper#3.5-features-of-the-mpos-consensus-mechanism).

:::warning warning

Running a validator node on the Nibiru Network runs the risk of your stake being slashed in 
the event that the computer acting as a validator node is unavailable.  This could be due to 
poor internet connectivity, a system crash, or power failure.  It's recommended that you only 
run a validator node if you have a highly-available system.

## Next Steps

Have the hardware and infrastructure to deploy a validator node on the Nibiru Network and want 
to get started?  Continue on to the [**Next Step**](validator-set-up.md) to configure and deploy 
your validator node.
