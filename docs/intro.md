# Getting started with Nibiru
---

[Nibiru Network](https://www.nibirunet.io) is a decentralized storage, bandwidth and compute
blockchain network that is designed to allow anyone to participate in a permissionless manner.
Anyone who has surplus storage, networking bandwidth and/or compute resources can easily 
become a part of the Nibiru ecosystem.

There are 3 ways to participate in the Nibiru ecosystem:

* **Share** your extra compute, storage, and network bandwidth resources to bring the vision of a truly decentralized cloud to reality.
* **Earn** rewards by staking in multiple ways or contributing your extra computing resources to the network.
* **Build** using your existing Solidity skills to build new, or migrate existing, Dapps to the EVM-compatible Nibiru Network.

## Share
Rarely do we fully utilize the storage space, bandwidth, or compute resources that our
computers have.  With the Nibiru Network's unique Proof of Flow (PoF) and Proof of Capacity (PoC)
layer 2 consensus mechanisms, you can turn those spare resources into rentable resources.

## Earn
When sharing your surplus computing resources, you are rewarded in two ways:
1. Through PoF and PoC consensus rewards
2. Through participants of the network renting your surplus resources for their personal or business needs.

## Build
As an EVM-compatible network, developers familiar with Ethereum development languages and toolchains
can focus on developing new, or migrating existing, Dapps for the Nibiru Network rather than learning new skills.  

## More coming soon!
While the Nibiru Network is [live](https://www.nibiruscan.io) today, we're currently focusing on encouraging
the community on-board to the network through deploying a validator node.  Later this year, network 
participants will be able to **Share** and **Earn**. If you're ready to help **Build** the Nibiru network
and earning MPoS NBN rewards, continue on to the [**Next Step**](become-a-validator/get-started-validator.md)
and deploy a validator.
