# Getting Started
---

[**UltronGlow**](https://www.ultronglow.io) is an EVM-compatible Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain network.
Validators on any PoS network perform the important task of ordering and appending transactions to
the ledger.  In UltronGlow, the PoS consensus mechanism has been improved to ensure any participant
that wants to validate on the netowrk has a fair chance to do so.  

Deploying a validator node on the UltronGlow network can be a technically complex process, requiring
skills in building and deploying code, as well as ensuring the Validator node is performant and highly-
available.  When deploying a validator, the deploying party must stake a minimum amount of 20 UTG, however the more
you stake, the more potential you have to generate blocks and earn rewards.

## Prerequisites

* Ensure your computer meets the following requirements:

  | Component      | Requirement          |
  |:---------------|:---------------------|
  | CPU            | 8 cores              |
  | RAM            | 32GB                 |
  | OS             | CentOS 7.2 64-bit    |
  | Disk (System)  | 100GB                |
  | Disk (Data)    | 2TB                  |

* [**Install Metamask**](https://metamask.io/download/) and create a new account if you haven't
  already.
* Purchase a minimum of 20 UTG (UltronGlow's native token) from
  [**Hotcoin Global**](https://www.hotcoin.com/) or [**Bitmart**](https://www.bitmart.com/) and transfer your UTG
  to your MetaMask wallet.

:::warning

Running a Validator on any PoS network runs the risk of your stake being slashed in the event that the computer acting
as a Validator is unavailable.  This could be due to poor internet connectivity, a system crash or power failure.  It's
recommended that you only run a Validator if you have a highly-available system.
