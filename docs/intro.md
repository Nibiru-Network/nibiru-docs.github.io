# Introduction
---

[Nibiru Network](https://www.nibirunet.io) is a decentralized storage, bandwidth and compute
blockchain network that is designed to allow anyone to participate in a permissionless manner.
Anyone who has surplus storage, networking bandwidth and/or compute resources can easily 
become a part of the Nibiru ecosystem.

There are 3 ways to participate in the Nibiru ecosystem:

* **Share** your extra compute, storage, and network resources to realize the potential of the decentralized cloud.
* **Earn** rewards by staking in a validator or contributing your extra computing resources to the network.
* **Burn** tokens by using services. This provides a deflationary token model and proof of network usage, ensuring long term success of the ecosystem.
* **Build** using your existing Solidity skills to build new, or migrate existing, Dapps to the EVM-compatible Nibiru Network.

## More coming soon!
While the Nibiru Network is [live](https://www.nibiruscan.io) today, we're currently focusing on encouraging
the community on-board to the network through deploying a validator node.  Later this year, network 
participants will be able to **Share**, **Earn** and **Burn**. If you're ready to help **Build** the Nibiru network
and earning MPoS NBN rewards, continue on to the [**Next Step**](become-a-validator/get-started-validator.md)
and deploy a validator.
